This project was created on through out the first week of my web dev program.
throughout this week ive learned how to code HTML aswell as CSS. 
Ive learned how to handle specific elements and atributes to manufacture a system of codes which
formed this web page. 
The use of box model made it very useful to construct sections of the page.
It took me awhile but Ive learned that there are many ways to contruct codes which presents the same outcome.

My Root folder are separated in three main folders containing my CSS, Photos and Fonts.
I chose to organize my folde this way to keep things easy to access and labeled friendly,

I used a hfre tag to later link those files from the folder.

my body consist of my navagation bar / Hero banner / Captions / Products / Sign-up bar and Footer.

My biggest challenge must have been putting together the responsive page layout. Figuring out the percentage,
then having to match the view points later one definitly posted a challenge.

My biggest take away from this is to work smarter not harder. by shorthanding my codes and linking multipule
element to later on style them all at once or even make further changes.

This site was created using Visual Studio Code.
