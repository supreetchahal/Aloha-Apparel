# Update: Aloha-Apparel Phase 2
README
January.23,2017
Upon the second week of being at RED, we were intoduced to Flexbox. A method of aligning things without having to deal with floats and clear fixes. Flexbox made it easy to replaced all floats, tweak any adjustments and remove any unnecessary margins and paddings. Flexbox allowed us to center align our headdings and texts within seconds. We were then working with javascript and got to learn different commands and to put together sets of instruction to make our buttons work. Java also made it possible to add an interative carousel to our page that displayed 4 additional products. This carousel was a plug in provided by Flickity (flickity.metafizzy.co/). My toughest challenge was and still is working with javascript. Struggling with javascript made it hard to impliment these comands and actions we get returned to us when certain buttons are pressed. Im challenged the most with structuring java codes and coming up with where to start. Although throughout this project i can say ive gotten some of the basics of JS down but more practice is in need. 

# Aloha-Apparel Phase 1

This project was created through out the first week of my web dev program at RED Acadamy. Throughout this week ive learned how to structure  HTML aswell as CSS codes.
Ive learned how to handle specific elements and attributes to manufacture a system of codes which formed this web page. The box model is very useful and makes dividing up sections of the page for us to build the layout with ease.
It took me awhile but Ive learned that there are many ways to contruct codes which can presents the same outcome.

Using the design comps that were provided for us in the project folder, i was able to build a rough skeleton on the backend website including everything in the correct order and structure then moved on to desiging the front face of the website using my CSS. The CSS makes it easier for us to style our work rather than using inline html styling technics; this method can be tedious and is out dated. 

My Root folder are separated in three main folders containing my CSS, Photos and Fonts.
I chose to organize my folde this way to keep things organized in the CSS sheets and also to learn how to link stylesheets within folders inside my root folder.

I used a hfre tag to later link those files from the folder.

My body consist of my navagation bar / Hero banner / Captions / Products / Sign-up bar and Footer.

My biggest challenge must have been putting together the responsive page layout. Figuring out the percentage,
then having to match the view points later one definitly posted a challenge.

My biggest take away from this is to work smarter not harder. by shorthanding my codes and linking multipule
element to later on style them all at once or even make further changes.

This site was created using Visual Studio Code.
